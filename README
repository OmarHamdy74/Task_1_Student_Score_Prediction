# Exam Score Prediction using Linear & Polynomial Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and predictive modeling for **exam scores** using:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Handling Missing Values**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression**
- **Model Evaluation (R², MAE, RMSE)**

The implementation is done in **Python** using Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Features

* Data cleaning and visualization using **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **missingno**
* Polynomial feature generation using `PolynomialFeatures`
* Model training using **LinearRegression**
* Performance evaluation:

  * **R² Score**
  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The project reports:

* **R² Score**: Measures how well the model explains variance
* **MAE**: Average absolute error
* **RMSE**: Penalizes larger errors
